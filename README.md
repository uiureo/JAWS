Welcome to **JAWS V1 BETA**.  We're still fixing many quirks.  Please provide fixes and feedback.  If you want to help, please view the **[JAWS V1 Google Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SeTgtsQc620vcwgGMZ4F2yuWVf-A3JmpTn1VT8pKYsA/edit#)**.

## Goals:

 - **No Servers:** The JAWS back-end is comprised entirely of AWS Lambda Functions.  You can develop/update/configure each separately without affecting any other part of your application.  Your app never goes down.  There is no app.  Only individual lambda functions can go down.
 - **Scale Infinitely:**  A back-end comprised of Lambda functions comes with a ton of concurrency.
 - **Be Cheap As Possible:**  Lambda functions run only when they are called, and you pay only when they are run.
 - **All Lambda Runtimes** While first release is `nodejs` only, we plan on adding supoport for all languages. This means each lambda in your JAWS project can be coded in the lang that best suites the problem.
 - **API Gateway Auto-Deploy** Creates your API endpoints for you on API Gateway.
 - **Multi-stage & Multi-Region:** Define stages for your project, and multiple regions with a stage. Driven by [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).

## Architecture

Graphics coming soon...

## Quick Start

The guide below gets you started quickly.  Later, check out the [best practices](https://github.com/jaws-stack/JAWS/wiki/v1:best-practices) guide in our  [wiki](https://github.com/jaws-stack/JAWS/wiki) for tips on security and more.

*  **[Setup an AWS account and create an administrative user](https://github.com/jaws-framework/JAWS/wiki/v1:-AWS-Account-setup)**

*  ```$ npm install jaws-framework -g```

*  ```$ jaws new project```

*  ```$ cd <new-project-name>```

*  ```$ jaws new action users create -b```

* ```$ jaws dash```

This will create a new jaws project, create a lambda function and endpoint, which you can immediately deploy via
`jaws dash`.  After deployment is complete, you will be given a url.  In the above example, you can access your
deployed lambda at `your_url/users/create`.

## Where do I go from here?

We're currently working on our [docs](./docs/), [wiki](https://github.com/jaws-stack/JAWS/wiki), [best practices](https://github.com/jaws-stack/JAWS/wiki/v1:best-practices) and [FAQ](https://github.com/jaws-stack/JAWS/wiki/FAQ) pages.

Once you become familar with JAWS, you can read the JAWS [plug-in module guide](./docs/plugin-module-guide.md) to start contributing JAWS modules to the community.
